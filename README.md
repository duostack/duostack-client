Duostack Command Line Client
============================

A command line client for the Duostack Ruby and Node.js hosting platform.

This project contains the client files themselves (under `src/`), along with the scripts and support files needed to build gem, npm, and tgz packages of the client.


Installation
------------

Install as a gem or npm package:

    gem install duostack
    
    npm install duostack

Or just copy the contents of `src/` to a location in your `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.


Usage
-----

Consult `duostack help` after installing for client usage details, or go to <http://docs.duostack.com/command-line-client-command-reference>.

To build gem/npm/tgz packages of the client, run `rake package`. Packages will be written to `packages/`. To build previous versions, just check out the git tag for the version number of interest, and run the rake task.


Running Tests
-------------

The test suite is being continuously improved. Currently, the test suite depends on access to the Duostack API and a set of valid user credentials being present (either in `~/.duostack` or provided as environment variables).

Real actions are taken on the platform during test execution. While no user data should be touched, it is recommended that you use a test account whenever running the test scripts. An easy way to do that is to provide `DSUSER` and `DSPASS` environment variables to the test script:

    DSUSER=testuser DSPASS=testpass rake test

If those are not present, the cached credentials in `~/.duostack` will be used (if present), and no tests of credentials syncing can be done.
